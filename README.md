# Welcome to Juniper SRX Config

I'm using Juniper SRX110H-VA gateway at home for my VDSL2 internet connectivity between my home and my ISP, I configured myself and I thought about this config, everyone can access and can use. When I doing some research about configs, I see in the forums people are having some issues with the config.

Now, I'm living in Turkey and using [turk.net](https://turk.net) ISP. You can edit some lines and use my config if you are living in Turkey. Otherwise, you should learn something before edit and commit the config.

# What should I know before start?

 1. What's your vlan id for VDSL/VDSL2 connection? **(Important)**
 2. Did you know your VDSL Username? **(Important)**
 3. Did you know your VDSL Password? **(Important)**
 4. Do you have a terminal cable for the upgrade process? **(Important)**
 5. Did you know your nameserver address? **(Not important)**
